# Book-exchanging-system
Software development project for 4th sem

A need for a robust system that helps in exchanging of books within a community of
members, so that a necessity of a member towards a book is at most satisfied.

Humans rely on books for information and knowledge. They have helped mankind evolve
and have a deep impact on us and are responsible for uplifting our spirits. People say that
books are their best friends. They are very useful for mankind and have enabled it to evolve.
Books are a great source of information and knowledge. They give us a deep feeling of wellbeing. The benefits of books are well known. They have contributed to the evolution of
mankind and have helped mankind to progress. Books have a profound impact on our lives
and improve our moods. Currently, only 17â€“22 percent of books available in classroom
collections are Nonfiction which gets declining every decade.
A community consisting of a large member might have many utilized Fiction and Nonfiction
books. A member in a community might require a book where another member in the same
community might have it and could be anonymous and there could be a high possibility that
the person could be an outsider. The idea is to develop a portal that can create interrelation
between the community members and exchange information about the books they own. The
community members should be able to list the books they are willing to exchange with others
in the forum and the database should store the information about the books listed by every
user. Members should be able to search for the required book and if it is available the owner
of the book can be contacted, private discussion can be done between them, and exchanges
can be initiated.
